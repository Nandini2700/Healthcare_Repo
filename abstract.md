Problem Statement: 
Empowering Corporate Wellness: Analyzing the Impact of Job Roles and Work Locations on Mental Health
Following the COVID-19 pandemic, remote work rapidly became the new norm, significantly transforming the work culture, particularly within the tech industry. In this project, we aim to visually represent the collected data to gain insights into the mental health conditions of employees working in various settings across the globe. This dashboard will help companies from diverse industries identify which work environments are most effective in maximizing productivity while prioritizing employeesâ€™ mental well-being.

Approach: 
1) Data Cleaning and Preparation: Python (Pandas - For data manipulation, and handling missing values, Numpy - For numerical operations and efficient data handling.)
2) Data Analysis & Visualization: Power BI.
3) (If time permits) Building predictive model: Machine Learning Algorithms.

Key performance Indicators:
1) Impact on mental health based on the mode of work.
2) Work life balance vary significantly based on the hours worked and virtual meetings attended 
3) Visualization of Mental Health Condition based on Region.
4) What is the relation of stress levels on quality of sleep and productivity changes?
5) How has remote work impacted productivity across different job roles and industries?
6) Are employees experiencing higher levels of social isolation more likely to report lower satisfaction with remote work?
7) What is the impact of physical activity on the mental health condition of remote workers?
